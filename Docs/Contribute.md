# 👷‍♂️ How to Get Involved with Helix

Helix is a decentralized oracle system designed to solve the “oracle problem” in Web3 by enabling factual verification through staking-based consensus.

This repo contains the white paper, vision documents, and reference materials for building the protocol.

## 🔧 What We're Looking For

We’re looking for collaborators across multiple disciplines:

### 🛠 Solidity / Smart Contract Engineers
- Help audit, improve, and implement `TruthClaim.sol`
- Implement staking pools, dark period logic, and final resolution
- Design mechanisms for dispute resolution or fork handling

### 🌐 Frontend / Full Stack Devs
- Build a clean, trustless dApp interface (React, Next.js)
- Allow users to create claims, stake, and view outcomes
- Integrate MetaMask, WalletConnect, etc.

### 🔬 Protocol Designers & Tokenomics Engineers
- Optimize staking incentives, originator fees, and dispute resolution timing
- Explore deployment on L2s (Optimism, Arbitrum, etc.)
- Prevent Sybil attacks and ensure sustainable decentralization

## 🚀 Why Work on Helix?

- Solves the **oracle centralization problem** in a fully on-chain way
- Establishes a **decentralized epistemic commons** for verifying public truths
- Designed to be a **public good**, not a rent-seeking platform

We’re not VC-funded, not corporate, and not interested in gatekeeping. This is a ground-up, open project for anyone serious about building truth infrastructure for Web3 and beyond.
