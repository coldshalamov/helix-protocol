# Helix Protocol

**A decentralized engine for observation, verification, and compression.**

Helix is the first blockchain designed to pay humans for the discovery, validation, and compression of truth. Being developed as a permanent, sub-terabyte archive of verified knowledge—rewarding users for submitting statements, betting on their relevance or accuracy, and compressing them using a novel generative proof-of-work system called **MiniHelix**.

Unlike legacy blockchains that mint tokens by wasting computation, Helix mints 1 HLX token for every **1 GB of verified compression** achieved. This ties the token’s value to a concrete storage-saving metric, not arbitrary block counts or time. Innovative Proof Of Work algorithm allows for mining and compression of multiple blocks at once, and even more important, allows the blockchain to compress and restructure itself while retaining underlying data fidelity.

## 🚀 What Makes Helix Different

🔍 **Epistemic Market**  
- Users submit claims about reality.  
- Others stake HLX tokens on whether those claims will be judged valid.  
- Final consensus is determined by collective stake—not central oracles.

🧠 **Compression = Proof-of-Work**  
- All submitted claims are grouped into **microblocks**.  
- Miners compete to find the **smallest seed** that regenerates the exact block output using a deterministic hash-based function:  
  `G(s) = Truncate_N(H(s || len(s)))`  
- The smaller the seed, the more compression—and the more HLX earned.

🧮 **Transparent Incentives**  
- Originators earn 1% of the voting pot for relevant claims.  
- Miners earn HLX for compressed blocks.  

📦 **Sub-Terabyte Chain**  
- Helix is designed to remain under 1 TB forever, regardless of usage volume, by leveraging recursive compression and block replacement.

🧬 **Data = Money**  
- Each byte saved via compression has monetary value.  
- The HLX token is hard-pegged to the real-world cost of storing 1 gigabyte of information.

## 🏗️ System Architecture Overview

1. **Users** submit human-readable claims (e.g. "JFK was assassinated in 1963").
2. Claims are grouped into microblocks capable of being generated by brute force randomization.
3. **Miners** search for generative seeds that regenerate those blocks.
4. Microblocks are "mined" when a miner finds a qualifying seed of equal or lesser length to the target microblock.
5. **Voters** stake HLX on whether the statement is valid or important.
6. Final consensus and block inclusion are recorded permanently when all the statement's microblocks are "mined".
7. Token rewards are distributed based on:
   - (Miners) Compression efficiency
   - (Statements Originators) Relevance of the statement (as judged by 1% of the betting activity on that statement)
   - (Voters) "Correctness": game-theory suggests that the betting contracts will converge toward "correct" more often than not. If so, a voter that simply is correct more often will make proportionally more money from their investment.

## 📚 Example Use Cases

- Archiving historical facts with global consensus  
- Crowdsourcing answers to unresolved questions  
- Compressing human scientific knowledge into a permanent, auditable form  
- Storing civic testimony, whistleblower reports, or legal evidence immutably
- General Decentralized Oracle for Web3 Applications

## 🛠 Installation

Helix is developed against **Python 3.13**. Earlier Python 3 versions may work, but 3.13 is recommended.

Install the required packages:

```bash
python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```

The only external dependency at the moment is [PyNaCl](https://pypi.org/project/PyNaCl/), which can also be installed directly:

```bash
pip install pynacl
```

## ⚙️ Genesis Setup

After installing the dependencies, create the initial keys and genesis event:

```bash
python setup_genesis.py
```

This mines the genesis microblocks and writes the results into the `data/` directory.

## ✅ Running Tests & Coverage

Install the test dependencies and execute the suite with coverage:

```bash
python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt
./run_tests.sh
```

Set `COV_FAIL_UNDER` to fail the run if coverage drops below a threshold (in percent):

```bash
COV_FAIL_UNDER=85 ./run_tests.sh
```

This runs `pytest --cov=helix tests/` and prints a coverage report to stdout.

## ❓ Troubleshooting

- **`ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'nacl'`**
  - Ensure dependencies are installed with `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
- **`RuntimeError: Failed to mine microblock`**
  - Mining can require many attempts. Verify PyNaCl is installed and rerun `setup_genesis.py` or increase the mining attempt limits.

## 🚦 Experimental Networking Layer

The initial prototype linked nodes using the in-memory `LocalGossipNetwork`.
To run nodes across machines, the new `helix.network` package introduces
socket-based transports for exchanging JSON gossip messages. This
architecture is designed to evolve toward peer discovery, message routing,
and optional encryption.
